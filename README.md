# NLP
Language Identification(LI) model  using  two methods
 -using one-hot character encoding 
 -using word embedding
 In one-hot charcter encoding, we use two LSTM networks embeded with attantion mechanism,
 wheres as theword embeding technques uses two stacked LSTm networks on the top of the embedding layer.
